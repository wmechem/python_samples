1) You're given a list that contains the prices of a stock during one trading day, 
at 1 minute intervals. The list is chronologically ordered. You want to buy and sell the stock 
the same day, and maximize your profit. 
Write a method that takes the list and returns the time to buy and time to sell in order to 
maximize your profit. *
